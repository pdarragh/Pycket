# Pycket

Pycket can be thought of as an extension to Python to make it more Racket-y (hence the name). It provides different base classes and overrides some regular Python methods to achieve this goal.

## Motivation

A while ago I started a project called [Kelpy](https://github.com/pdarragh/Kelpy). This was my own take on designing a simple functional language using Python as the interpreter. However, I eventually realized that many of the features that Racket provided that were missing in Python were actually pretty useful when building a language (go figure). So I decided to move some aspects of the project into a separate project (this one) to make it more portable.

I don't know how successful this project will be, but I wanted to take a crack at it, so here we are. Fingers crossed it works out.
